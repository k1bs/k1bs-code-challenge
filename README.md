# Code Challenge Solution

pizzas.js contains my solution for the code challenge. The code is organized into ES6 classes. The class for part 2 extends the class from part one.

To use you will need to do

```javascript
const part1 = new PizzaSingle()
part1.processMove('string of directions')
```

and

```javascript
const part2 = new PizzaSquad()
part2.processSquadMove('string of directions')
```

respectively.

Thanks!
